# ..Modlishka..

Modlishka is an open-source penetration testing tool that acts as a man-in-the-middle proxy. It implements a novel technical approach to handling browser-based HTTP traffic flow, which allows it to transparently proxy multi-domain destination traffic, both TLS and non-TLS, over a single domain, without requiring the installation of any additional certificate on the client. This enables multiple practical use cases.

Modlishka was the first publicly released research tool, in 2019, to demonstrate automated Adversary-in-the-Middle (AitM) phishing techniques capable of bypassing many common 2FA implementations — with the goal of raising awareness and improving real-world defenses.

The project was created to highlight authentication flaws and is intended strictly for authorized research and professional security testing.


From a security perspective, Modlishka can currently be used to:
-	Support ethical phishing penetration tests with a transparent and automated reverse proxy component that has a universal 2FA “bypass” support.
-  Wrap legacy websites with a TLS layer, confuse crawler bots and automated scanners, etc.


Modlishka was written as an attempt to overcome standard reverse proxy limitations and as a personal challenge to see what is possible with sufficient motivation and a bit of extra research time. 
The achieved results appeared to be very interesting and the tool was initially released and later updated with an aim to:
- Highlight currently used two-factor authentication ([2FA](https://blog.duszynski.eu/phishing-ng-bypassing-2fa-with-modlishka/)) scheme weaknesses, so adequate security solutions can be created and implemented by the industry.
- Support other projects that could benefit from a universal and transparent reverse proxy.
- Raise community awareness about modern phishing techniques and strategies and support penetration testers in their daily work.


Modlishka was primarily written for security-related tasks. Nevertheless, it can be helpful in other, non-security related, usage scenarios.

Features
--------

Key features of Modlishka include:

**General:**
-   Point-and-click HTTP and HTTPS reverse proxying of an arbitrary domain/s.
-   Full control of "cross" origin TLS traffic flow from your users browsers (without the requirement of installing any additional certificate on the client).
-   Easy and fast configuration through command line options and JSON configuration files.
-   Pattern based JavaScript payload injection.
-   Wrapping websites with an extra "security": TLS wrapping, authentication, relevant security headers, etc. 
-   Stripping websites of all encryption and security headers (back to 90's MITM style). 
-   Stateless design. Can be scaled up easily to handle an arbitrary amount of traffic  - e.g. through a DNS load balancer.
-   Can be extended easily with your ideas through modular plugins.
-   Automatic test TLS certificate generation plugin for the proxy domain (requires a self-signed CA certificate)
-   Written in Go, so it works basically on all platforms and architectures: Windows, OSX, Linux, BSD supported...

**Security related:**
-  Support for majority of 2FA authentication schemes (out of the box).
-   Practical implementation of the "[Client Domain Hooking](https://blog.duszynski.eu/client-domain-hooking-in-practice/)" attack. Supported with a diagnostic plugin.
-  User credential harvesting (with context based on URL parameter passed identifiers).
-  Web panel plugin with a summary of automatically collected credentials and one-click user session impersonation module (proof-of-concept/beta).
-  No website templates (just point Modlishka to the target domain - in most cases, it will be handled automatically without any additional manual configuration).
